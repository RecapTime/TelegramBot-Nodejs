Recap Time Node.js Telegram Bot
===========

The Telegram bot for our [Recap Time bot](https://t.me/RecapTime_bot) is fully re-written in Node.js from strach. 

If you want to contribute, please use [our GitLab mirror](https://gitlab.com/MadeByThePinsTeam-DevLabs/RecapTime-Staff/recaptime-tgbot-nodejs) and [the original Glitch project](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/handsome-sheet). We'll stop our support services for GitHub users, so our apologies.
## Setup and Usage
- Install Node.js and Git first.
- Clone the project to your machine.
```shell
$ git clone https://gitlab.com/MadeByThePinsTeam-DevLabs/RecapTime-Staff/recaptime-tgbot-nodejs.git
```
- Copy the contents from `.env.sample` to .env or export those variables manually by hand.
- Install dependencies first by simply run `npm install`.

We've been moved our documentation into somewhere. Check them out soon.
