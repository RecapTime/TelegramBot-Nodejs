## Editing the User Manual

* This User Manual is made with Glitch: That means anyone can modify and customize their own copy. Ask our team for an invite.
* For those who want to go into the *fork-commit-MR* way, there is [our GitLab mirror] available for you.
* Here's a [markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet), in case you need it.
